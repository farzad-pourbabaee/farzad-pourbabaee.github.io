        <b>Abstract.</b> In a misspecified social learning setting, agents are condescending if they perceive their peers as having private information that is of lower quality than it is in reality. Applying this to a standard equential model, we show that outcomes improve when agents are mildly condescending. In contrast, too much condescension leads to worse outcomes, as does anti-condescension.

        <b>Abstract.</b> We study mechanism design for public-good provision under a noisy privacy-preserving transformation of individual agents' reported preferences. The setting is a standard binary model with transfers and quasi-linear utility. Agents report their preferences for the public good, which are randomly  ``flipped,'' so that any individual report may be explained away as the outcome of noise. We study the tradeoffs between preserving the public decisions made in the presence of noise (noise sensitivity), pursuing efficiency, and mitigating the effect of noise on revenue.

        <div class="content"><p>
        <b>Abstract.</b> We study a social bandit problem featuring production and diffusion of knowledge. While higher connectivity enhances knowledge diffusion, it may reduce knowledge production as agents shy away from experimentation with new ideas and free ride on the observation of other agents. As a result, under some conditions, greater connectivity can lead to homogeneity and lower social welfare.

        <div class="content"><p>
        <b>Abstract.</b> I introduce a dynamic model of learning and random meetings between a long-lived agent with unknown ability and heterogeneous projects with observable qualities. The outcomes of the agent's matches with the projects determine her posterior belief about her ability (i.e., her reputation). In a self-type learning framework with endogenous outside option, I find the optimal project selection strategy of the agent, that determines what types of projects the agent with a certain level of reputation will accept. Sections of the optimal matching set become <i>increasing intervals</i>, with different cutoffs across different types of the projects. Increasing the meeting rate has asymmetric effects on the sections of the matching sets: it unambiguously expands the section for the high type projects, while on some regions, it initially expands and then shrinks the section of the low type projects.

    <li>Delegated Learning and Non-Credible Communication (with <a href="https://peter-mccrory.github.io/" style="color:#46535E" target="_blank">Peter B.

        <div class="content"><p>
            <b>Abstract.</b> We consider a setting in which an impatient agent acquires payoff-relevant information about the true state of the world. The agent endogenously chooses when to stop learning, at which point an uninformed principal takes an action to maximize her own expected payoff. The agent's preferences are biased relative to the principal's, generating misalignment of expected payoffs. When communication is non-credible, the principal can only rely upon the agent's endogenous stopping rule when strategically specifying her course of action. In the no-communication equilibrium, the agent adopts a one-sided stopping rule as a function of her posterior belief that is consistent with the principal's pre-specified course of action at the time of stopping. When the principal has commitment power, relative to the full-communication equilibrium, the agent is always worse off; for intermediate values of prior beliefs, the principal is better off. The one-sided equilibrium stopping rule (and associated action) can switch discretely as a function of prior beliefs, generating dramatic regime changes for arbitrarily small changes in beliefs. When learning is initiated in the no-communication equilibrium there is a non-zero probability of indefinite delay, in which the agent never ceases learning and the principal never takes an action.

    <li>Tail Probability Estimation of Factor Models with Regularly-Varying Tails: Asymptotics and Efficient Estimation (with <span style="color:#46535E">Omid Sham Solari</span>)<br><A href=papers/TPE.pdf target="_blank"><i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> PDF</A> | <A href=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4078304 target="_blank">SSRN</A> |<button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
        <div class="content"><p>
            <b>Abstract.</b> We study the tail probability of linear factor models generated from non-identically distributed components with <i>regularly-varying</i> tails, a large subclass of heavy-tailed distributions. An efficient sampling method for tail probability estimation for this class is introduced and theoretically shown to exponentially outperform the crude Monte-Carlo estimator, in terms of the coverage probability and the confidence interval's length. The theoretical results are empirically validated through stochastic simulations on independent non-identically Pareto distributed factors. The proposed estimator is available as part of a more comprehensive TPE package.

    <div class="content"><p>
    A decision maker's utility depends on her action \(a \in A \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) and the payoff relevant state of the world \(\theta \in \Theta\). One can define the value of acquiring new information as the difference between the maximum expected utility pre- and post information acquisition. In this paper, I find asymptotic results on the expected value of information as \(d \to \infty\), by using tools from the theory of (sub)-Guassian processes and generic chaining.

    <li>Robust Experimentation in the Continuous Time Bandit Problem<br><span style="font-size:15px; font-weight:500;">Economic Theory, 2020.</span> &nbsp &nbsp <A href=papers/Robust_Bandit.pdf target="_blank"><i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> PDF</A> | <A href=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00199-020-01328-3 target="_blank"> Published Paper</A> | <A href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00102 target="_blank">arXiv</A> |<button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
    <div class="content"><p>
      <b>Abstract.</b> We study the experimentation dynamics of a decision maker (DM) in a two-armed bandit setup (Bolton and Harris [1999]), where the agent holds <i>ambiguous</i> beliefs regarding the distribution of the return process of one arm and is certain about the other one. The DM entertains <i>Multiplier preferences</i> &aacute; la Hansen and Sargent [2001], thus we frame the decision making environment as a two-player differential game against <i>nature</i> in continuous time. We characterize the DM's value function and her optimal experimentation strategy that turns out to follow a cut-off rule with respect to her belief process. The belief threshold for exploring the ambiguous arm is found in closed form and is shown to be increasing with respect to the ambiguity aversion index. We then study the effect of provision of an unambiguous information source about the ambiguous arm. Interestingly, we show that the exploration threshold rises unambiguously as a result of this new information source, thereby leading to more <i>conservatism</i>. This analysis also sheds light on the efficient time to reach for an expert opinion.

    <p><b>First paragraph of the Intro <span style="color: red">(<i class="fas fa-syringe"></i><i class="fas fa-vial"></i> Covid prophecy!)</span></b> There are natural cases where the experimentation shall be performed in ambiguous environments, where the distribution of future shocks is unknown. For example, consider a diagnostician who has two treatments for a particular set of symptoms. One is the conventional treatment that has been widely tested and has a known success rate. Alternatively, there is a second treatment that is recently discovered and is due to further study. The diagnostician shall perform a sequence of experiments on patients to figure out the success/failure rate of the new treatment. However, the adversarial effects of the mistreatment on certain types of patients are fatal, thus the medics must consider the <i>worst case</i> scenario on the patients while evaluating the new treatment.</p>
