        <b>Abstract.</b> I introduce a dynamic model of random search where ex ante heterogeneous venture capitalists (investors) with unknown abilities match with a variety of startups (projects). There is incomplete yet symmetric information about investors' types, whereas the projects' types are publicly observable to all investors. In the unique stationary equilibrium, the matching sets, value functions and steady state distributions are endogenously determined. Interpreting the market posterior belief about the venture capitalists' ability as their reputation, I study the outcomes of the economy when the success or failure of the projects create feedback effects: innovation spillovers and reputational externalities. When there are positive spillovers from successful early stage projects to late stage business opportunities, I show increased levels of search frictions could save the market from breakdown caused by the neglect of spillover effect. When the reputational externality is at play, namely when the deal flow of each investor is inversely impacted by the distribution of other investors' reputation, I show the proportion of the high ability inactive investors is inefficiently high, and the projects suffer from early termination.

    		<b>Abstract.</b> We consider a setting in which an impatient agent acquires payoff-relevant information about the true state of the world. The agent endogenously chooses when to stop learning, at which point an uninformed principal takes an action to maximize her own expected payoff. The agent's preferences are biased relative to the principal's, generating misalignment of expected payoffs. When communication is non-credible, the principal can only rely upon the agent's endogenous stopping rule when strategically specifying her course of action. In the no-communication equilibrium, the agent adopts a one-sided stopping rule as a function of her posterior belief that is consistent with the principal's pre-specified course of action at the time of stopping. When the principal has commitment power, relative to the full-communication equilibrium, the agent is always worse off; for intermediate values of prior beliefs, the principal is better off. The one-sided equilibrium stopping rule (and associated action) can switch discretely as a function of prior beliefs, generating dramatic regime changes for arbitrarily small changes in beliefs. When learning is initiated in the no-communication equilibrium there is a non-zero probability of indefinite delay, in which the agent never ceases learning and the principal never takes an action.

    <li>Robust Experimentation in the Continuous Time Bandit Problem<br><b style="font-size:15px;">Accepted in <i>Economic Theory</i>.</b> &nbsp &nbsp <A href=papers/Robust_Bandit.pdf target="_blank"><i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> PDF</A> | <A href=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00199-020-01328-3 target="_blank"> Published Paper</A> | <A href=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3189845 target="_blank">SSRN</A> |<button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

      <b>Abstract.</b> We study the experimentation dynamics of a decision maker (DM) in a two-armed bandit setup (Bolton and Harris [1999]), where the agent holds <i>ambiguous</i> beliefs regarding the distribution of the return process of one arm and is certain about the other one. The DM entertains <i>Multiplier preferences</i> &aacute; la Hansen and Sargent [2001], thus we frame the decision making environment as a two-player differential game against <i>nature</i> in continuous time. We characterize the DM's value function and her optimal experimentation strategy that turns out to follow a cut-off rule with respect to her belief process. The belief threshold for exploring the ambiguous arm is found in closed form and is shown to be increasing with respect to the ambiguity aversion index. We then study the effect of provision of an unambiguous information source about the ambiguous arm. Interestingly, we show that the exploration threshold rises unambiguously as a result of this new information source, thereby leading to more <i>conservatism</i>. This analysis also sheds light on the efficient time to reach for an expert opinion.

    <p><b>First paragraph of the Intro <span style="color: red">(<i class="fas fa-syringe"></i><i class="fas fa-vial"></i> Covid prophecy!)</span></b> There are natural cases where the experimentation shall be performed in ambiguous environments, where the distribution of future shocks is unknown. For example, consider a diagnostician who has two treatments for a particular set of symptoms. One is the conventional treatment that has been widely tested and has a known success rate. Alternatively, there is a second treatment that is recently discovered and is due to further study. The diagnostician shall perform a sequence of experiments on patients to figure out the success/failure rate of the new treatment. However, the adversarial effects of the mistreatment on certain types of patients are fatal, thus the medics must consider the <i>worst case</i> scenario on the patients while evaluating the new treatment.</p>
